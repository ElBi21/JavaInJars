# Introduction

The **Programming 2** course I took during my first year at Sapienza was about
Object Oriented programming, and the language that was used to teach us this programming
paradigm was **Java**. This is a mere collection of files that explain useful concepts
behind the vast world of **OOP** and Java itself. Each lesson has its own package, for a
whopping total of around **20** packages
